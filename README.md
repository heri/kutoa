# Kutoa - Rebuilding Hope

## Vision

Connect potential donators and displaced refugees needing assistance:

* Refugees can post their needs and goals in housing, education or employement
* Donators can pledge a monthly amount. When there are enough donators, the amount is given to the refugee. This is kiva meets indiegogo!
* Special care is given to make sure genuine refugees & genuine needs are on the site. View the about page!

## Project description

### Overview

Kutoa gives back hope and purpose to refugees.

With the support of a local sponsor, a refugee can show needs and goals. Donators can give $10/mo to help achieve this goal. An optional amount can be given for Kutoa administration fees.

Currently, Kutoa supports 3 kinds of goals: employment, education, employment.

* A refugee can get housing and basic needs with the help of a local host.
* A refugee can show an education goal, such as kids schooling, continuous education, language courses, skill adapation etc.
* A refugee can show an employment goal. Often, this means a local person would help them adapt his skills. It can be a company offering an internship, a technical skill etc.

Kutoa encourages refugees and sponsors to post a specific project, with a goal, a beginning date and end date.

### Verification

Every application goes through due diligence, when possible:

1. Is there a local sponsor? The local sponsor has an existing relationship with the refugee, and can support to achieve goal(s). The sponsor will also have the responsability to give the money
2. Is the person a real refugee? Currently Kutoa only supports political refugees. Kutoa reviews refugee passport, U.N.H.C.R. file, local N.G.Os files, when possible
3. Is the person a good member of the community? Kutoa looks for peer & local reviews, as well as other elements such as pictures and videos demonstrating this

### Case Updates

Strong & regular updates by the refugee can demonstrate trust.

Updates can be messages to donators and the community, sharing life challenges or successes, or education & employment advancement. Donators are notified in real-time of updates

After the first donation, Kutoa requires bi-weekly case updates from the refugee to get the remaining donations.

### People

Based on discussions with Felipe Coimbra who travelled in the Balkans and saw the plight of refugees

Thanks to Mohamed Alborno for his support and feedback saturday night. Palestinian refugee, Mohamed does not have a country. Kutoa can give purpose to Palestinian and Syrian refugees.

Thanks to Aimable Dusingizimana for his words. While Kutoa cannot solve the roots of the crisis, it would have helped Rwandan refugees like Aimable who fled the genocide.
